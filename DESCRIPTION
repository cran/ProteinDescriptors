Description: An implementation of protein descriptors in R. These descriptors
    combine the advantages of being fixed length and including partial sequential
    effect: Various length of protein sequences are described with fixed length
    vectors that are suitable for machine learning algorithms, and still includes
    partial sequential effect.
